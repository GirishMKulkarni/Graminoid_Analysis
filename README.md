# Functional Types Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing functional types abundance and richness data as part of a publication. The scripts perform various analyses and generate figures for visual representation.


## Files

- `FT_richness_abundance.csv`: CSV file containing richness and abundance data for functional types.
- `FTabundance.csv`, `FTrichness.csv`: CSV files containing abundance and richness data.
- `Impenvvariables.csv`: CSV file containing important environmental variables.
- `FTabundance_wo_abundant_graminoids.csv`: CSV file containing abundance data excluding graminoids.
- `Abundance_ANOVA.csv`, `Richness_ANOVA.csv`: Output files containing ANOVA results for abundance and richness, respectively.
- `Abundance_tuckey.csv`, `Richness_tuckey.csv`: Output files containing Tukey's HSD results for abundance and richness, respectively.

## Figures

- **Figure 2**: Proportion of species and individuals per functional types (pie charts).
- **Figure 3**: Box plots for abundance and richness per functional types.
- **Figure 4**: CCA using all species and functional types.
- **Figure 5**: CCA excluding abundant graminoids.
